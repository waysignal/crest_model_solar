A python adapation of the Solar Cost of Renewable Energy Spreadsheet Tool from NREL.

From their website: "The Cost of Renewable Energy Spreadsheet Tool (CREST) contains economic, cash-flow models designed to assess project economics, design cost-based incentives, and evaluate the impact of state and federal support structures on renewable energy."

Modeled results are below and are validated by comparing the after-tax running IRR found in the Cash Flow sheet.
